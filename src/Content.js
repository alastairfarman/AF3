        I have 10 years experience in ecommerce over a variety of photography,
        retouch and studio workflow roles. In June 2022 I began self-teaching frontend web development
        focusing on JavaScript and React. I'm particularly interested in user
        interaction and incorporating new media into smooth experiences.
