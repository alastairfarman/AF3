          I have 10 years experience in ecommerce over a variety of photography,
          retouch and studio workflow roles. In 2021 I started playing with 3D sofware for fun. In June 2022 I began self-teaching
          frontend web development focusing on JavaScript and React through The Odin Project, YouTube and other online educational services. I'm
          particularly interested in user interaction and incorporating different media into smooth experiences.
